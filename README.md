# Mendelmax 1.5 3D Printer Configurations

## Description
The reprap firmware configuration files and cura profiles for the MendelMax MK3 3D Printer.

## Installation
To install the cura profiles, copy the content from the folder "Cura Profiles" to "{cura_installlation_folder}/resources/". Tested for working on Cura 4.8.

For the firmware, copy the "Config file" folder content to the SD card of the Duet WiFi controller. 

The macros folder contains a few usefull macros, add them manually to use them.

The bin folder contains the firmware to be installed on the Duet WiFi controller. I recommend using the lastest firmware from [Duet3D](https://github.com/Duet3D) / [RepRapFirmware](https://github.com/Duet3D/RepRapFirmware).
